# Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction Model
This repository contains a notebook in which, using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries I attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting (at an early stage) whether or not someone has risk of having diabetes.

How advantagous it is to detect diabetes at an early stage?
In early diabetes, symptoms may be absent, making it easy to overlook. Untreated high blood sugar can damage blood vessels and the nervous system, leading to various complications. Thus, early identification and treatment of diabetes can effectively reduce these risks.
